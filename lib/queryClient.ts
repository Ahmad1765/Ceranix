// the hand-rolled caches we're replacing (lib/freshness, lib/listingCache):
//
//  - staleTime = FEED_TTL_MS (60s): a screen that re-mounts / re-focuses within
//    the window reuses cached data instead of refetching — exactly what the old
//    isFresh() gate did, now for free and per-query.
//  - gcTime 5m: keep data around after a screen unmounts so back-navigation is
//    instant (the role lib/listingCache played).
//  - retry 2 with capped backoff: the Supabase web client occasionally wedges;
//    a couple of retries recovers most transient failures without hanging.
//  - refetchOnWindowFocus off: this app drives focus refetches explicitly via
//    expo-router; staleTime already covers the "reuse if fresh" case.

// rehydrate the old shape and crash on mount. Changing this discards the whole
