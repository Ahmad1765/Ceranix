# Carrinex — React Native / Expo Performance Audit

**Date:** 2026-07-30
**Branch:** `feature/push-notifications`
**Stack (verified from `package.json` / resolved config):** Expo SDK `~54.0.36`, React Native `0.81.5`, React `19.1.0`, Hermes (default), New Architecture (default-on in SDK 52+, not disabled here), Expo Router `~6.0.24`, Reanimated `~4.1.1` + `react-native-worklets@0.5.1`, NativeWind `4.1.23`, TanStack Query `5.101`, Supabase JS `2.45`.
**Workflow:** managed / CNG — no `android/` or `ios/` directories.

## Phase 1 — Research basis

Every recommendation below is anchored to one of these current sources. Nothing here is speculative or carried from memory.

| Source | What it established |
|---|---|
| [Expo — React Compiler](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/) | `experiments.reactCompiler: true` is the enable switch; Babel auto-configured in SDK 54+; app code only, no node_modules; validate with `react-compiler-healthcheck` |
| [Expo — Tree shaking](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/tree-shaking/) | `EXPO_UNSTABLE_TREE_SHAKING=1`, `EXPO_UNSTABLE_METRO_OPTIMIZE_GRAPH=1`; barrel/star-export expansion; ESM-only; production-only |
| [Expo — Analyzing bundles](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/analyzing-bundles/) | `EXPO_ATLAS=true npx expo export` is the current bundle-inspection path (source-map-explorer is SDK ≤50) |
| [Expo — New Architecture](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/new-architecture/) | SDK 54 is the **last** SDK where New Arch can be disabled; ~83% of SDK 54 EAS builds already on it |
| [RN — Optimizing FlatList configuration](https://reactnative.dev/docs/optimizing-flatlist-configuration) | `windowSize`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, `initialNumToRender`, `getItemLayout`, `removeClippedSubviews` semantics + tradeoffs; memoize row components; no anonymous `renderItem` |
| [FlashList v2 docs](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/docs/) / [Expo SDK — flash-list](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/flash-list/) | v2 is built for the New Architecture and **requires Fabric**; `npx expo install @shopify/flash-list`; no config plugin; FlatList-compatible API |
| [Expo SDK 54 changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog/sdk-54) | RN 0.81 + React 19.1; precompiled iOS XCFrameworks |

**Local verification run during the audit:**

```
$ npx react-compiler-healthcheck@latest
Successfully compiled 156 out of 156 components.
StrictMode usage not found.
Found no usage of incompatible libraries.

$ npx tsc --noEmit      → exit 0
$ npx expo lint         → 0 errors, 1 warning (unused var, AnonCards.tsx:146)
```

---

## Phase 2 — What the codebase actually does

~35.7k lines of TS/TSX across `app/` (24 routes), `components/` (61), `lib/` (55).

Already correct — **do not "fix" these**:

- **Data layer is sound.** TanStack Query with a central key factory (`lib/queries.ts`), `staleTime: 60s`, `gcTime: 5m`, AsyncStorage persistence with a version buster, `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` with explicit `useFocusEffect` + `isStale` gating. This is the modern pattern, correctly applied.
- **The like/save N+1 is already solved.** `lib/engagementCache.ts` collapses what would be 60+ per-card round-trips into one query per user per 30s, with in-flight dedupe and optimistic writes.
- **Images already use `expo-image`** in 27 files (only one stray `react-native` `Image`), with `cachePolicy="memory-disk"`, `recyclingKey`, `priority`, and CDN width negotiation via `lib/images.ts`.
- **Feed payloads are already slimmed** — `SELECT_FEED` in `lib/listings.ts` drops `description` and narrows the seller embed.
- **Auth context identity is already stabilized** (`lib/auth.tsx`) after the documented infinite-refetch incident.
- **`babel.config.js` is correct.** Two presets, no manual `react-native-worklets/plugin` — SDK 54's `babel-preset-expo` injects it. Adding it back would triple-stack the transform.
- **The two `useNativeDriver: false` sites are correct and must stay** — `app/auth/login.tsx` interpolates into `height`, `components/discover/SearchTabs.tsx` interpolates a color. Neither is native-driver-capable.
- **Native font blocking in `app/_layout.tsx` is deliberate and correct** — Android does not repaint mounted `<Text>` when a font registers late.
- **Zero `console.log` in `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`.**

---

## Phase 3 — Issues found

Ranked by impact × confidence. Every issue below is verified against the actual source, not inferred.

### P0-1 — No list virtualization anywhere. Every listing grid mounts every row.

**Where:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx:768` (`Grid`), `app/(tabs)/discover.tsx:1210`, `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx:1023` (`ListingsGrid`), `app/user/[id].tsx:611`.

All four are the same shape: a plain `<ScrollView>` whose children are `rows.map(...)` → `<ListingCard>`. There is no `FlatList`, `SectionList`, or `FlashList` on any grid — RN's virtualized list primitives appear only in `chat.tsx`, `conversation/[id].tsx`, and the followers/following screens.

**Why it's a problem.** Query limits are 48–60 rows (`useMyFeedListingsQuery` → 48/60, `useFeedListingsQuery({limit: 60})`, `searchListings({limit: 60})`). Every one of those rows mounts immediately, on the JS thread, before first paint of the grid. And `ListingCard` is not cheap — per card:

- a `PressableScale` (Reanimated node)
- a `PopIcon` (second Reanimated node)
- for multi-image listings, a **nested horizontal paging `ScrollView`** with one `expo-image` per photo
- an `onLayout` handler that calls `setCardWidth` → a second render of every card
- a `useEffect` that resolves `fetchIsLiked` → `setLiked` → a third render of every card

So a 60-row feed mounts ~60 nested scroll containers, 60–180 image views, ~120 Reanimated nodes, and does ~180 renders during mount. This is the dominant cost on the two most-visited screens in the app.

**Impact:** slow first paint on Home and Discover; jank and dropped frames while scrolling; memory held for off-screen images that `removeClippedSubviews` would otherwise release; worst on low-end Android.
**Estimated improvement:** the largest single win available. Mount work drops from *N* rows to roughly one viewport plus the draw-distance buffer — for a 60-row feed that is ~8–12 cards instead of 60. Expect a step-change in time-to-interactive on Home/Discover and in scroll smoothness, not a marginal one.
**Risk of fixing:** **Medium.** These grids sit inside scroll views that also host headers, chip rows, and rails, so the fix is a real restructure (list header component + `numColumns`), not a drop-in. FlashList v2 additionally **requires the New Architecture** — satisfied here, but it is a hard requirement.

---

### P0-2 — `ToastProvider` creates a new context value on every render, re-rendering the whole app.

**Where:** `lib/toast.tsx:155` — `<ToastContext.Provider value={{ show }}>`.

`ToastProvider` wraps the entire `<Stack>` in `app/_layout.tsx`. It holds `useState` for `toast` and `visible`, so **every toast show, every dismiss, and every animation-completion callback re-renders the provider** — and each of those renders allocates a fresh `{ show }` object.

**Why it's a problem.** React compares context values by identity. A new object every render means every `useContext(ToastContext)` consumer re-renders, unconditionally. `ListingCard` calls `useToast()`. So **showing any toast re-renders all 60 listing cards** — and `React.memo` on `ListingCard` cannot stop it, because context propagation bypasses memo entirely.

This is the same class of bug as the `lib/auth.tsx` infinite-refetch incident already documented in this repo, and every *other* provider in the tree (`GuestGate`, `SellSheet`, `DiscoverSheet`, `Auth`) already memoizes its value correctly. Toast is the one that was missed.

**Impact:** a visible stutter every time a toast fires while a grid is on screen — which is exactly when toasts fire (like failed, item saved, feed removed).
**Estimated improvement:** eliminates 60+ wasted component renders per toast event, ×4 events per toast lifecycle (show, animate-in, timer, dismiss).
**Risk of fixing:** **Very low.** One-line `useMemo`. `show` is already a stable `useCallback`.

---

### P1-1 — React Compiler is not enabled, and this codebase is its ideal candidate.

**Where:** `app.config.js` — `experiments` contains only `typedRoutes: true`.

The code style throughout is inline arrow props and inline style objects — `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` alone passes ~15 inline `onPress` closures and every `style={{...}}` is a fresh object per render. That is a deliberate, readable style, and hand-memoizing it all would be a large, risky, low-value diff.

**Why it matters.** React Compiler does exactly that memoization automatically at build time, without touching the source. Per Expo's docs it is auto-configured in SDK 54 and applies to app code only.

**The healthcheck passes cleanly on this repo: 156/156 components compile, no incompatible libraries, no StrictMode conflicts.** That is an unusually clean result and the strongest possible signal to turn it on.

**Impact:** broad reduction in re-render work across every screen, at zero source-diff cost.
**Estimated improvement:** moderate and diffuse — meaningful on render-heavy screens (Home, Discover, `product/[id]`), invisible elsewhere. It does **not** substitute for P0-1; virtualization and memoization solve different problems.
**Risk:** **Low-medium.** It is still flagged experimental by Expo. Behaviour changes only if a component violates the Rules of React — the healthcheck found none. Rollback is deleting one config line.

---

### P1-2 — `lucide-react-native` is a dependency with zero imports.

**Where:** `package.json:53`. Grep across `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` returns **no matches**.

Icons come from `@expo/vector-icons` (`Feather`, `Ionicons`) everywhere.

**Why it's a problem.** Even with Metro's dead-code elimination, an unused dependency is install weight, lockfile surface, audit surface, and a standing invitation to import a *second* icon system. Icon libraries are also the canonical barrel-file bundle hazard called out in Expo's tree-shaking guide.

**Impact:** small but free. **Risk of fixing:** **Very low** — nothing imports it.

---

### P1-3 — `ListingCard` does three render passes per card on mount.

**Where:** `components/ListingCard.tsx:31–67`.

Three independent state writes fire during mount for every card:
1. `useState(0)` → `onLayout` → `setCardWidth(width)` (line 146)
2. `useEffect` → `fetchIsLiked(...).then(setLiked)` (line 55)
3. `useEffect` on `[listing.likes]` → `setLikeCount` (line 65–67) — this one fires on mount even though `likeCount` was already initialized to the same value at line 34.

**Why it's a problem.** #3 is a strictly redundant render on every card. #1 forces the image to render at a placeholder width (`cardWidth || 200`) then re-render at the true width — and the parent grid *already computes the exact card width* via `useGridDimensions` and passes it down as a wrapper `style={{ width: cardWidth }}`. The measurement is re-deriving a number the parent already knows.

**Impact:** ~120 avoidable renders on a 60-card grid mount, plus a first-frame image at the wrong source width.
**Estimated improvement:** modest on its own; compounds significantly with P0-1 since it is per-card cost.
**Risk of fixing:** **Low-medium.** Passing `cardWidth` down as a prop is a behavioural no-op but touches all four grid call sites. The `likeCount` guard is trivial.

---

### P1-4 — Metro tree shaking is available but not switched on.

**Where:** no `EXPO_UNSTABLE_TREE_SHAKING` / `EXPO_UNSTABLE_METRO_OPTIMIZE_GRAPH` anywhere in `eas.json` or the build scripts.

Per Expo's guide these are production-only, ESM-only, and expand star-exports so unused barrel members are dropped — directly relevant to `@expo/vector-icons`, `lucide-react-native` (see P1-2), and `components/ui/index.ts`.

**Impact:** smaller production bundle → faster JS parse/eval → faster cold start.
**Estimated improvement:** unknown without measurement. **This must be measured with `EXPO_ATLAS=true npx expo export` before and after, not assumed.**
**Risk:** **Medium.** Explicitly marked unstable by Expo. Requires a full export + smoke test on both platforms before it goes anywhere near a production channel.

---

### P2-1 — Screen freezing (`react-native-screens`) is not configured.

No `enableFreeze`, `enableScreens`, or `freezeOnBlur` anywhere in the codebase. With six tab screens (several data-heavy), blurred tabs keep re-rendering on context and query-cache changes.

**Caveat that matters:** there is a live report of `freezeOnBlur: true` + `enableFreeze(true)` interacting badly with tab-bar rendering on iOS around `expo ~54.0.31` / `react-native-screens ~4.19.0` — and this app uses a **fully custom** `AnimatedTabBar` with Reanimated shared values and gesture state. That is precisely the configuration those reports involve.

**Impact:** moderate CPU/battery saving on backgrounded tabs.
**Risk:** **Medium-high for this specific app.** Recommend deferring until P0/P1 are shipped and measured, then trialling on one screen at a time with device testing. Not a blind enable.

---

### P2-2 — Minor allocation churn on the Home screen.

`app/(tabs)/index.tsx:112` — `const priceDrops = priceDropsQ.data ?? []` allocates a new array every render, while the three sibling queries correctly use module-level stable constants (`EMPTY_LISTINGS`, `EMPTY_SAVED_SEARCHES`, lines 58–59).

It happens not to feed a `useMemo` dependency today, so it is currently harmless — but it is inconsistent with the stable-reference discipline the rest of the file establishes, and would silently become a bug the moment someone memoizes on it.

**Impact:** negligible now, cheap insurance. **Risk of fixing:** **Very low.**

---

### P2-3 — `components/AnonCards.tsx:146` — `SectionEyebrow` defined but never used.

The only lint warning in the repo. Dead code. **Risk of fixing: none.**

---

## Non-issues — checked and explicitly cleared

So these are not re-litigated later:

- **New Architecture** — on. Default in SDK 52+, not disabled in `app.config.js`. No migration needed.
- **Hermes** — on. Default engine, not overridden.
- **Babel/Reanimated plugin ordering** — correct, and the existing comment explains why the manual plugin entry must stay absent.
- **Metro config** — correct. `getSentryExpoConfig` + `withNativeWind` in the right order.
- **TypeScript** — `strict: true`, clean compile, path aliases configured.
- **Secrets** — no keys in source. `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` for public values only (correct: anon key, DSN, PostHog key are all publishable). `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` isolated in `.env.sentry-build-plugin` and read by the plugin, not the bundle. `expo-secure-store` present and plugin-registered.
- **`@mediapipe/tasks-vision`** — never enters the Metro bundle; loaded from jsDelivr at runtime in `lib/photoClean/engine.web.ts`, web-only. Correctly handled.
- **OTA / `runtimeVersion`** — `fingerprint` policy with `fallbackToCacheTimeout: 0`. Correct: never blocks cold start on an update fetch.
- **Supabase client** — hard fetch timeout, bounded auth lock with graceful fallback. Well-hardened.
- **Realtime subscriptions** — `lib/chat.ts` channels are all paired with `removeChannel` in cleanup. No leak.
- **`LiveActivityTicker` `setInterval`** — cleaned up on unmount; native-driven where possible. Fine.
- **Accessibility** — `accessibilityRole`/`Label`/`State` and `hitSlop` presets used consistently. Nothing below should reduce this.

## Phase 4 — Recommended sequencing

| Tier | Items | Risk | Verify with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — apply now** | P0-2 toast memo, P1-2 remove dep, P2-2 stable ref, P2-3 dead code | Very low | typecheck + lint |
| **2 — apply + verify** | P1-1 React Compiler | Low-med | healthcheck (already green) + device smoke test |
| **3 — needs a decision** | P0-1 virtualization, P1-3 card render passes | Medium | full manual pass over all 4 grids, both platforms |
| **4 — defer, measure first** | P1-4 tree shaking, P2-1 screen freezing | Medium+ | `EXPO_ATLAS` before/after; per-screen device trial |

Tier 3 is where the real performance is. It is also the only tier that changes UI-critical code, and it adds a runtime dependency that hard-requires Fabric.

---

## Phase 5 — What was applied, and how it was verified

Tiers 1–3 are **applied**. Tier 4 is **not** — it is left documented above.

| Issue | Change | Files |
|---|---|---|
| P0-2 | `useMemo` the toast context value | `lib/toast.tsx` |
| P1-2 | Removed unused `lucide-react-native` | `package.json`, `package-lock.json` |
| P2-2 | Stable `EMPTY_PRICE_DROPS` reference | `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` |
| P2-3 | Deleted dead `SectionEyebrow` | `components/AnonCards.tsx` |
| P1-1 | `experiments.reactCompiler: true` | `app.config.js` |
| P1-3 | `width` prop replaces `onLayout` measure; first-run guard on the `likeCount` effect | `components/ListingCard.tsx` |
| P0-1 | FlashList v2 on all four grids | `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/discover.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`, `app/user/[id].tsx` |

### How the virtualization was done, and why this shape

Each of the four screens wraps its grid in a scroll view that also carries a
header, chips, rails, and tab panels. Rather than restructure those trees, the
existing tree became `ListHeaderComponent` and **only the grid rows moved into
FlashList's `data`**. That is safe here because of a property that holds on all
four screens: **the grid is always the last element rendered in its branch**, so
"header, then rows" puts the rows exactly where the inline grid was.

Two deliberate choices, both trading a little theoretical throughput for a lot of
certainty:

1. **Rows are the list item, `numColumns` stays 1.** `data` is `Listing[][]`, and
   each row renders the same flex-row with the same fixed `cardWidth` the old
   code used. The grid is therefore pixel-identical — the wrapper's
   `paddingHorizontal` moved onto the row and its vertical `gap` became a
   `marginBottom`. Using flat data with `numColumns={columns}` would recycle
   individual cells slightly better, but it would hand grid layout (and the
   padding/gap math) to FlashList on four screens with four different constants.
   Not worth the regression risk for the marginal gain.
2. **`ListHeaderComponent` is passed an element, never `() => <Header/>`.** An
   inline function is a new component type on every render, which remounts the
   header — that would drop focus from the search fields on Home and Discover on
   every keystroke. This is called out in a comment at each of the four sites.

**Follow-up — `components/WebRefresh.tsx` was subsequently deleted** (see the
"Web pull-to-refresh removal" section at the end of this document).

### Verification

Every gate below was run against the **actual changed tree**.

```
npx tsc --noEmit                → 0 errors
npx expo lint                   → 0 errors, 0 warnings   (baseline had 1 warning)
npx vitest run                  → 17 files, 155/155 passed
npx expo export -p web          → exit 0, bundle 5.1 MB
npx react-compiler-healthcheck  → 156/156 components compiled
```

**E2E, measured against a baseline rather than assumed.** The Playwright suite
runs against the static web export with Supabase fully mocked. The changed tree
was run, then the changes were stashed, the app was re-exported, and the identical
suite was run again on unmodified `feature/push-notifications`:

| | Passed | Failed |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (stashed) | 124 | 35 |
| With these changes | 126 | 33 |

**Every one of the 33 failures under the changes is also present in the baseline
list — there are no new failures.** Two baseline failures
(`web-pull-refresh.spec.ts:35`, `signed-in/saved-searches.spec.ts:158`) did not
recur; they look like timing flakes and are *not* claimed as fixes here.

### ⚠️ Pre-existing: the E2E suite is substantially red on this branch

33 specs fail on unmodified `feature/push-notifications`, independent of any of
this work. They cluster into:

- `tab-navigation.spec.ts` + `responsive.spec.ts` — tab-bar locators, almost the
  whole `chromium-iphone-se` project
- `product-detail.spec.ts:25` — fails on all four viewport projects
- `network-failure.spec.ts` — three specs
- `signed-in/chat-inbox.spec.ts` — three specs

This matters beyond hygiene: a suite this red cannot detect a real regression,
which is why the stash-and-compare above was necessary to say anything
trustworthy about these changes. Worth its own pass.

### Rollback

Each item is independently revertible:

- **React Compiler** — delete `reactCompiler: true` from `app.config.js`.
- **FlashList** — `git revert` the four screen files; `components/ListingCard.tsx`'s
  `width` prop is optional and back-compatible, so it can stay either way.
- **Toast memo / dead code / unused dep** — one-line reverts, no coupling.

---

## Web pull-to-refresh removal (same day, follow-up)

### Why `refreshing`/`onRefresh` cannot solve this on web

The natural question is "FlashList and FlatList already have refresh — just use
it." They do, and it is already in use on all seven screens. It works on
iOS/Android. On web it is inert, and the chain is verifiable in installed source:

1. FlashList v2 constructs the control itself —
   `@shopify/flash-list/dist/recyclerview/hooks/useSecondaryProps.js:36`:
   ```js
   React.createElement(react_native_1.RefreshControl, { refreshing, progressViewOffset, onRefresh })
   ```
   `FlatList` does the same thing.
2. On web, Metro aliases `react-native` → `react-native-web@0.21.2`.
3. That package's entire `RefreshControl` implementation
   (`dist/exports/RefreshControl/index.js`) is:
   ```js
   function RefreshControl(props) {
     var colors = props.colors, enabled = props.enabled, onRefresh = props.onRefresh,
       refreshing = props.refreshing, tintColor = props.tintColor, /* …all of them… */
       rest = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(props, _excluded);
     return React.createElement(View, rest);   // every refresh prop discarded
   }
   ```
4. Upstream [necolas/react-native-web#1027](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/issues/1027)
   has been open since **July 2018** — milestone "TBD", no assignee, no PR.

No maintained library closes the gap either:
[`react-native-web-refresh-control`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-web-refresh-control)
(v1.1.2, ~2 yrs stale, open issue #11 *"Stuck on pull down release"*, and it
patches `FlatList` not FlashList);
[`react-simple-pull-to-refresh`](https://github.com/thmsgbrt/react-simple-pull-to-refresh)
(owns its own scroll container — incompatible with a virtualized list);
[`pulltorefreshjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pulltorefreshjs) (5 yrs stale).

### What was removed, and why

`components/WebRefresh.tsx` (253 lines) hand-rolled the gesture with DOM
`touch`/`wheel` listeners. Two structural defects made it unstable:

1. **`setPull()` on every gesture event** (old lines 112, 142). The hook was
   called *inside each screen component*, so every frame of a pull re-rendered
   all of Home/Discover/Profile at gesture framerate.
2. **Listeners bound once on mount** (old line 61) behind a 10×100ms retry. If
   the scroll node appeared late or was later replaced, the gesture died with no
   recovery — and the FlashList migration made node replacement more likely.

Deleted: `components/WebRefresh.tsx`, `tests/e2e/web-pull-refresh.spec.ts`, and
the hook/indicator wiring from all seven screens. **Native `RefreshControl` is
untouched everywhere** — `refreshControl={...}` is still passed on all seven.
Mobile web now falls back to the browser's own pull-to-refresh, which the old
code actively suppressed via `e.preventDefault()`.

Tradeoff, stated plainly: **desktop web now has no in-app refresh affordance.**
There is no native browser pull gesture there. If that matters, a header Refresh
button calling the existing `onRefresh()` is the fix — it was offered and not
taken, so it is not implemented.

### Bug found and fixed during this work

`FlashListRef` exposes `scrollToOffset`, **not** `scrollTo`. Discover's four
scroll-to-grid jumps used `scrollRef.current?.scrollTo?.({ y, animated })` — the
optional call meant they silently did nothing after the FlashList migration
rather than throwing. This was a regression introduced by that migration and is
now corrected to `scrollToOffset({ offset, animated })` at
`app/(tabs)/discover.tsx` lines 478, 515, 535, 590.

### Verification

```
npx tsc --noEmit    → 0 errors
npx expo lint       → 0 errors, 0 warnings
npx vitest run      → 155/155 passed
npx expo export -p web → exit 0
```

E2E, same stash-and-compare discipline as above:

| | Total | Passed | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Original baseline | 165 | 124 | 35 |
| After FlashList work | 165 | 126 | 33 |
| After this removal | **162** | 124 | **32** |

The 3-test drop is exactly `web-pull-refresh.spec.ts` (1 failing + 2 passing),
which was deleted with the feature. No new failures. Two specs
(`tmp-dummy-shot`, `saved-searches.spec.ts:158`) flip between runs, which
identifies them as flaky rather than as regressions.

### Still unmeasured

The gains argued in Phase 3 are mechanical (mounting ~1 viewport of rows instead
of 48–60) and the build/test gates confirm nothing broke — but **no on-device
frame timing or startup measurement was taken.** Before/after profiling on a
low-end Android device is the honest next step, along with
`EXPO_ATLAS=true npx expo export` if Tier 4 tree shaking is ever picked up.

## Feed scroll, pass 3 (2026-08-02)

Virtualization (P0-1) capped *how many* cards are alive; the earlier
`peekLikedIds` fix removed the extra render per card. What was left is the cost
of the card itself, paid on **every FlashList recycle** — which is precisely the
work that lands mid-scroll. All three items below are per-card-per-recycle, and
none of them changes a pixel.

| # | Change | File |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Carousel slides mount lazily | `components/ListingCard.tsx` |
| 2 | Dropped the Reanimated wrapper around the card photo | `components/ListingCard.tsx` |
| 3 | Cached `Intl.NumberFormat`; skip the throwaway `new URL()` parse | `lib/currency.ts`, `lib/images.ts` |

### 1 — Multi-photo cards mounted every photo

A grid card is a thumbnail first and a gallery second, but the paging
`ScrollView` mounted one `expo-image` per photo unconditionally. A 4-photo
listing therefore built four native image views and fired four downloads for a
card the shopper may never swipe — times every card FlashList mounts and
re-mounts while scrolling, all competing with the *visible* photos for both the
JS thread and the connection pool.

Now only slide 0 is real; the rest render as empty slots **of the exact same
width**, so paging geometry, dot count, and scroll offsets are identical from
the first frame — only the pixels arrive later. `onTouchStart` hydrates the rest
on finger-down, before the drag produces any movement, so the images are
requested well before the swipe lands.

Two invariants keep this honest on a recycled card:

- A slide is also rendered real when `i === activeIndex`, so an instance parked
  mid-carousel never shows an empty slot.
- The `[listing.id, user?.id]` effect resets the hydrated flag. Cards that were
  never swiped are already `false` and React bails out of the unchanged
  setState, so this costs a render only on cards the shopper actually opened.

**Tradeoff, stated plainly:** the second photo now starts loading at finger-down
rather than at card mount. On a cold cache a fast swiper can meet a blank slide
for a moment. That is the price of not spending 3–5× the image budget on photos
nobody looks at, and it is the right trade for a browsing grid.

### 2 — `Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Image)` with nothing animated

`ListingCard` wrapped every photo in a Reanimated animated component and then
passed it a plain style object — no shared value, no animated style, ever. The
wrapper was pure overhead: a Reanimated-managed component plus its props node,
per photo, per card, per recycle. Now it uses `expo-image` directly, with a
comment at the import so it does not get "restored".

`app/product/[id].tsx` has the same wrapper and is **left alone** — that is the
hero carousel, a different screen with a different scroll story, and out of
scope for a feed-scroll pass.

### 3 — Two hot helpers doing native work per render

- **`formatPrice`** used `Number.prototype.toLocaleString('en-US', …)`, which
  constructs a fresh formatter on every call — on Hermes a JSI hop into the
  platform number formatter (ICU on Android, Foundation on iOS). It runs **three
  times per card render** (accessibility label, item price, total). Three
  `Intl.NumberFormat` instances are now built lazily and reused. Output parity
  was checked across 18 value/option combinations before the swap; falls back to
  the old per-call API if an engine has no `Intl`.
- **`getOptimizedImageUrl`** ran `new URL(url)` on every image on every render,
  then — with the Supabase transform flag off, which is the default — returned
  the original string unchanged. A two-`String.includes` guard now short-circuits
  before the parse. Every documented case still reaches the code it did before;
  `lib/images.test.ts` covers both flag states and is unchanged.

### Verification

```
npx tsc --noEmit          → 0 errors
npx expo lint             → 0 errors, 0 warnings
npx vitest run            → 17 files, 155/155 passed
npx expo export -p web    → exit 0, bundle 4.81 MB
```

One trap worth recording: the **first** `expo export` after this failed with
`TypeError: dependencies is not iterable`. That is a stale incremental Metro
graph, not a code fault — removing the `react-native-reanimated` import from
`ListingCard` desyncs the cached module graph. `npx expo export -p web --clear`
succeeds. Clear the cache before believing that error.

E2E was **not** re-baselined for this pass. The suite is red for unrelated
reasons (see above), no spec asserts carousel or image behaviour, and nothing
here changes layout or the DOM shape — so a stash-and-compare run would have
produced noise, not signal.

### Still open

- **Nothing here is measured on-device.** Same caveat as the pass above, and it
  is now the binding constraint: the remaining candidates cannot be ranked
  without a trace.
- **FlashList `drawDistance`** is at its 250 default while a grid row is roughly
  310px tall, so a fast flick can outrun the buffer. Raising it trades more
  mount work for fewer blank cells — exactly the trade that needs a measurement
  to settle, especially now that mount work per card is cheaper.
- **`PopIcon` costs 3 Reanimated nodes + 2 icon glyphs per card.** Both layers
  must stay mounted for the cross-fade, so there is no free win — it would be a
  design change, not an optimization.

## Pass 4 (2026-08-02) — React Compiler was silently off on the hot path

### The finding

`experiments.reactCompiler: true` has been set since Pass 1, and the
`react-compiler-healthcheck` run recorded above ("156 out of 156 components") was
read as proof it was working. It is not the same thing. The healthcheck reports
whether components *could* compile in principle; it does not run the plugin the
way `babel-preset-expo` runs it in a build.

Running the real plugin over the real tree tells a different story. The two most
expensive components in the app were getting **zero** compiler memoization:

| File | Compiled | Bailed |
|---|---|---|
| `components/ListingCard.tsx` | **0** | `try/finally` |
| `app/product/[id].tsx` | **0** | `try/finally` ×4 |
| `app/(tabs)/discover.tsx` | 7 skeletons | `DiscoverScreen` — `try/finally` |
| `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` | 11 | `ProfileScreenInner` — memo dep mismatch |
| `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` | 6 | `InboxScreen` — eslint-disable |
| `lib/toast.tsx` | `useToast` only | `ToastProvider` — ref during render |
| `lib/auth.tsx` | `useAuth` only | `AuthProvider` — memo dep mismatch |

`ToastProvider` and `AuthProvider` wrap the entire application.

### Why it is invisible

`babel-preset-expo` runs the plugin with `panicThreshold: 'NONE'` in production.
A component the compiler cannot lower is skipped **silently** — no warning, no
build failure, nothing visible in the bundle unless you go looking. And a bailout
is per-component, not per-function: one unsupported statement anywhere inside a
component body forfeits memoization for that entire component.

### How to check it (do this after touching any pattern below)

`react-compiler-healthcheck` is not sufficient. Run the plugin directly with a
logger. `babel-preset-expo` cannot be used for this — it needs Metro's
`supportsReactCompiler` caller flag, and it swallows the diagnostics anyway:

```js
babel.transformSync(src, {
  filename: file,
  presets: [[require('@babel/preset-typescript'), { isTSX: true, allExtensions: true }]],
  plugins: [[require('babel-plugin-react-compiler'), {
    target: '19',
    logger: { logEvent(_f, e) { console.log(e.kind, e.fnName, e.detail?.options?.reason); } },
  }]],
});
```

`CompileSuccess` events name the components that made it; `CompileError` gives
the reason and the line.

### The patterns that bail out, and what to write instead

These are limitations of `babel-plugin-react-compiler@1.0.0`, not code smells in
themselves. None of the rewrites change behaviour.

1. **`try { … } finally { … }`** — *"Handle TryStatement with a finalizer"*. Move
   the finalizer body after the `try/catch`. Only equivalent when neither block
   does `return`/`break`/`continue` or re-throws — **verify that each time**.
   Where an early `return` existed, it was restructured into a result variable
   and a single exit path.

2. **Value blocks inside `try`/`catch`** — *"Support value blocks (conditional,
   logical, optional chaining, etc) within a try/catch statement"*. `?.`, `??`,
   `?:`, `&&`, `||` are all forbidden in those bodies. Hoist them above the
   `try`, or call a helper. `lib/errors.ts` was added for the common case
   (`errorMessage`, `isAbortError`) so catch clauses stay bare.

3. **`throw` inside `try/catch`** — *"Support ThrowStatement inside of
   try/catch"*. `app/conversation/[id].tsx` used `throw new Error('insert
   returned no row')` to funnel a falsy result into its own catch; that is now a
   branch on the result.

4. **Refs touched during render** — *"Cannot access refs during render"*. Two
   shapes, both common here:
   - `someRef.current = value` in the component body → sync inside a `useEffect`.
   - `useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current` → `useState(() => new Animated.Value(0))`.
     Independently a small real win: the `useRef` form constructs an
     `Animated.Value` on *every* render and discards all but the first, while the
     lazy initializer runs once.

5. **`useCallback`/`useMemo` dependency mismatch** — *"Existing memoization could
   not be preserved … Inferred less specific property than source"*. This one is
   a genuine correctness signal, not a quirk. Reading `user.id` in a body whose
   dep list says `user?.id` makes the compiler infer the whole object. Narrow
   once (`const userId = user?.id ?? null`) and depend on the primitive. In
   `app/conversation/[id].tsx` this is also strictly more precise: those
   callbacks no longer churn when an unrelated field of `conv` changes on every
   incoming realtime event.

And one real latent bug the suppressions were hiding: `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`
assigned `activeTabRef.current = activeTab` during render. Both of that file's
`eslint-disable react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comments are now gone — the compiler
refuses to optimize any component where a React ESLint rule was disabled, so a
suppression costs the whole screen its memoization.

### Result

`app/` + `components/`: **193 → 202 components compiled, 23 → 16 files with
bailouts**, and every remaining bailout is on a cold screen (`settings`, `login`,
`onboarding`, `payment`, `invoice`, `news`, `ratings`, `wardrobe/new`,
`profile/edit`, `conversation/new`) or a Reanimated shared-value writer.

**The Reanimated ones are deliberately left alone.** `AnimatedTabBar`,
`PressableScale`, `OfferSheet` and `SlideToConfirm` bail with *"This value cannot
be modified"* on `sharedValue.value = …`. Hoisting the handlers into `useCallback`
was tried on `PressableScale` and does **not** fix it — the limitation is the
write itself, and the experiment was reverted. It costs little regardless:
`AnimatedTabBar` is explicitly built so interaction never re-renders React at
all, so there is almost no render work there to memoize.

## Pass 4, part 2 — list tuning, the last unvirtualized grid, the card carousel

### `drawDistance` — the Pass 3 open item, now closed

`lib/responsive.ts` exports `GRID_DRAW_DISTANCE = 700`, applied to all four
listing grids plus the new wardrobe grid. The geometry, so it isn't a magic
number: on a 390pt phone the grid is 2 columns → card 179pt wide → photo 238pt
tall (aspectRatio 1/1.33) + ~76pt text + 24pt margins ≈ **338pt per row**.
FlashList's default of 250 is less than a single row, so a flick outran the
buffer. 700 buys ~2 rows of runway. This is the trade Pass 3 flagged as needing a
decision; it is worth taking *now* precisely because Pass 3 cut the per-card
mount cost first.

### FlatList tuning — there was none anywhere in the app

A grep for `windowSize|initialNumToRender|maxToRenderPerBatch|removeClippedSubviews|getItemType|drawDistance`
returned **no matches** across the entire codebase before this pass. Now set on
the inbox (`chat.tsx`) and both follow lists.

`app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` also had `ItemSeparatorComponent={() => …}` — a new
component *type* every render, which unmounts and remounts every separator — and
handed `InboxRow` a fresh `onPress` closure, defeating the `memo` it already had.
Both fixed (`InboxSeparator`, and `InboxListRow` owns the navigation).

### `fetchFollowers` / `fetchFollowing` were unpaginated — now fixed

`lib/follows.ts` had no `.limit()` and no pagination on either list: a seller
with 5,000 followers pulled all 5,000 edge rows plus a profile join for each,
before a single name rendered. The list tuning above bounds the *rendering* cost
and can do nothing about the query.

Both now page at `FOLLOW_PAGE_SIZE = 30` through a shared `fetchFollowPage`
helper, with `useFollowersQuery` / `useFollowingQuery` converted from `useQuery`
to `useInfiniteQuery` (same shape as `useHomeFeedQuery`) and both screens wired
to `onEndReached` with a footer spinner.

Choices worth recording:

- **Offset paging via `.range()`, not a `created_at` keyset**, to match the
  convention `lib/listings.ts` already uses. The tradeoff is the standard one: a
  follow added while the reader is mid-scroll shifts the window and can repeat or
  skip a row at a page boundary. Acceptable for a follow list; switch to a keyset
  on `(created_at, id)` if it ever isn't.
- **`isRefetching` had to be gated on `!isFetchingNextPage`.** It is true during
  `fetchNextPage` too, so without that the pull-to-refresh control spun every
  time the reader hit the bottom.
- **The follow mask still covers every loaded id**, so it refetches as pages
  accumulate. `placeholderData: (prev) => prev` keeps rows from flashing back to
  "Follow" during that refetch. One `.in()` query per page is cheap enough to
  leave alone.

Covered by `lib/follows.test.ts` (8 tests): the range window per page, the
`follower_id`/`followee_id` direction of each list, edge-order preservation
across the profile join, missing-profile rows being dropped rather than left as
holes, and an empty page skipping the profile round-trip (an empty `.in()` would
otherwise match every profile).

### `WardrobeGrid` was the last unvirtualized grid

`app/(tabs)/wardrobe.tsx` rendered `posts.map(...)` inside a plain `ScrollView`.
Converted to the same row-virtualized FlashList shape as the other four grids.

The parent `ScrollView` had to be **removed**, not kept: a FlashList nested in a
ScrollView gets unbounded height and silently mounts every row, which would have
made the change worthless. The padding moved to props.

### The card carousel now scrolls on the UI thread

`ListingCard`'s photo carousel used a plain `onScroll` at
`scrollEventThrottle={16}` — a JS-thread callback every frame of every swipe, on
a card inside a feed that is itself scrolling and recycling. It is now
`useAnimatedScrollHandler` writing a shared value, with the dots reading it in
`useAnimatedStyle`, so a swipe repaints without any React render. The JS thread
is crossed once per *page change* via `useAnimatedReaction`, only because
`activeIndex` still gates which slides mount for real (the Pass 3 lazy-slide
invariant).

The dots look exactly as before — 5px, solid white on the current page, 55% white
otherwise. Only the mechanism moved.

### Considered and rejected: prefetching the product hero on card press

The idea was that tapping a card should warm the full-size hero image. It would
be dead code. Listing photos are Supabase storage public URLs and
`EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM` is off by default, so
`getOptimizedImageUrl` returns the **identical** URL for the card and the hero —
expo-image already holds it in its memory-disk cache. Worth revisiting only if
that transform flag is ever switched on.

### Still open after this pass

- **Still nothing measured on-device.** Every claim above is mechanical (fewer
  mounted views, fewer renders, work moved off the JS thread) and gated by
  typecheck/lint/tests/export — but no frame timing or startup trace was taken.
  Four passes in, this is now the binding constraint: what remains cannot be
  ranked without a trace.
- **Cold screens without compiler coverage** — `settings.tsx` alone has 10
  bailouts. All the same mechanical patterns; low value because those screens
  render once.

### Pass 4 verification

```
npx tsc --noEmit          → 0 errors
npx expo lint             → 0 errors, 0 warnings
npx vitest run            → 18 files, 163/163 passed
npx expo export -p web    → exit 0
```

E2E, with the same stash-and-compare discipline as the earlier passes — the
suite was run on the changed tree, the tree was reverted to the parent commit,
re-exported, and the identical suite run again:

| | Passed | Failed | Skipped |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (parent commit) | 124 | 32 | 6 |
| With Pass 4 | 124 | 32 | 6 |

The failing **sets** were diffed, not just the counts: **byte-identical**. Zero
new failures, zero disappeared. (The suite's 32 pre-existing failures are the
long-standing ones documented above and are unrelated to this work.)
